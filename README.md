### About
The PEACEFUL OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (POSL)

### How it works
The enduser has to accept the PEACEFUL OPEN SOURCE PROXY LICENSE.<br>
In order to do that, he must accept one of the two sublicenses*:<br>
If he chooses none or breaks the POSL, he automatically accepts the EPOSL.

****PEACEFUL OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (POSL)<br>
1. PEACEFUL USE<br>
 -> No Military<br>
 -> No animal abuse, fishing, etc.<br>
 -> No violation of human rights or privacy<br>

2. Recursive relicensing<br>
  -> All components stay POSL, even if the enduser modifies them<br>
  -> Endusers customers need to accept POSL in order to use POSL components (they have to comply with PEACEFUL USE)<br> 
3. Copy of the POSL needs to be included with the endusers product<br>
4. POSL-components are without warranty and fitness for a particular purpose<br>

****EXTENDED PEACEFUL OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (EPOSL)
Includes everything the POSL has PLUS:

5. As long as the enduser uses EPOSL components, restrictions (6. + 7.) are still active
6. Project-Freeze: Enduser is not allowed to develop his/her project any further (except to comply with EPOSL)
7. EVERYONE is allowed to reverse engineer EVERY product of the enduser as long as he uses EPOSL licensed components, without complying with EPOSL.


### How to use the license?
To make use of this license, the enduser has to accept the <br>
PEACEFUL OPEN SOURCE PROXY LICENSE (POSPL).<br>
