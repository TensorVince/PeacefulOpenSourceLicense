### About
This license was created to sanction violence of any kind.

### How to use this license?
To make use of this license, the enduser has to accept the <br>
PEACEFUL OPEN SOURCE PROXY LICENSE (POSPL).<br>
In order to do that, he must agree to one of the two sublicenses:<br>
If he chooses none or breaks the POSL, he automatically accepts the EPOSL.

## POSL and EPOSL summarized:

### PEACEFUL OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (POSL)

1. **PEACEFUL USE**
    * No Military
    * No animal abuse, fishing, etc.
    * No violation of human rights or privacy<br>
2. Recursive relicensing
    * All components stay POSL, even if the enduser modifies them
    * Endusers customers need to accept POSL in order to use POSL components<br>
  **(they have to comply with PEACEFUL USE)**<br> 
3. Copy of the POSL needs to be included with the endusers product
4. POSL-components are without warranty and fitness for a particular purpose
<br>

### EXTENDED PEACEFUL OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (EPOSL)

Includes everything the POSL has PLUS:

5. As long as the enduser uses EPOSL components, restrictions (6. + 7.) are still active, even if he breaks other terms
6. Project-Freeze: Enduser is not allowed to develop his/her project any further (except to comply with EPOSL)
7. EVERYONE is allowed to reverse engineer EVERY product of the enduser as long as the enduser uses EPOSL licensed components



## Summary
    This means following for the enduser/company
    if they ever violated human law or privacy
    or harmed animals, fishes or other fauna:

    * the enduser/company can be sued anytime
    * reverse engineering can be used to proof that the enduser/company used (E)POSL-licensed components)
    * the endusers/companies tradesecrets can be legally exposed (this can cost the enduser lots of money)
    * reputational damage (loss of customers => again, loss of money)
